# **API Governance Project**  

Welcome to the **API Governance Project**, an open-source initiative dedicated to improving the **quality, consistency, and compliance** of APIs within organizations. This project leverages the **AML Modeling Framework (AMF)** to efficiently **parse, generate, and validate** API specifications, ensuring robust API governance and adherence to industry best practices.  

## üöÄ **Features**  

‚úî **Comprehensive Metadata Parsing**  
Leverages **AMF** to parse various API specifications, including:  
- **RAML**  
- **OpenAPI (OAS) 2.0 / 3.0**  
- **AsyncAPI 2.0**  
- **JSON-LD ("AMF model")**  

‚úî **Validation and Compliance**  
- Ensures that APIs conform to **best practices** and **industry standards**.  
- Detects inconsistencies and enforces **organization-wide policies**.  

‚úî **Extensible Framework**  
- Supports **custom AML-defined models** to extend functionality.  
- Plugins can be used to support additional formats and models.
